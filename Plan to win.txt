Fruit Ninja game
*********************
    Fruits appear on canvas from bottom of the screen and fly in a 
    randomized parabolic trajectory back to the bottom. The user mouseOver
    the fruits to slash them and to gain game points. The user allowed to
    miss 10 fruits before the game ends. The game forms a highest score board 
    at the end.

Iteration 1: Minimal Viable model
    canvas height 800px, width 1200px, static background
    circles with randomly generated raduis enters from the bottom of the
    canvas and fly in an expected trajectory to from height 800 to height 300.
    circles are emmited from random place width between 200 and 1000.

    the circles are an object with the property isSlashed = false by default.
    when clicked or hovered over isSlashed is changed to true.
    when isSlashed = true circles change color/shape/disappear.
    at this point total score gets incremented.

    if the circle reaches height 800 it is considered missed.
    at this point fruitsLeftToMiss gets decremented. 

    when the mouse move around the screen it leaves a trace of some kind,
    tail, bunch of small circles that grow smaller and dissapear.

Iteration 2: Building on fundamentals
    the game is possible to start over without refreshing the page.
    the game keeps track of highest score and displays the table of 5 last 
    scores next to the restart button 

    circle objects are replaced with simple 2d fruit pictures.
    There are 3-5 fruit pictures which are picked randomly.
    when isSlashed = true images of fruit change to different images
    like slashed fruit.

Iteration 3: Adding features
    add starting screen which have start game button and a choise of 3
    difficulty levels.
    difficulty levels change the interval of fruits generating. More difficult - 
    more fruits generated. 
    Bonus points if slashed fruits in one stroke.
    or if you cut 2 fruits within 500ms


Structure:
    Class fruit {
      constructor() {
      this.isSlashed = false;
      this.x=500
      this.y=800;
      this.width=50;
      this.height=50;
      }
    
      drawItself() {
        ctx.fillRect(this.x, this.y, this.width, this.height);
      }

      moveItself() {
        ctx.clearRect(this.x, this.y, this.width, this.height)
              Quadratic curve
      context.quadraticCurveTo(cx, cy, x, y);

      y=x^2 ?
      y = randomModifier * x^2 ?
      }
    }

class Game {
  constructor() {
    this.fruitsArr = [] // every time i create a fruit I push it to this array

            // every time the fruit get slashed I remove it from the array after showing the image or time like 2s
  }
}


    
function startGame() {
  //how to create new fruits every so often?
  setInterval(()=>{
    fruit = new fruit();
    fruit.drawItself()
    animate(fruit);
//should i call animate on a every object, does the animate function need to receive this object?
  }, 300)


  }

function animate(newFruit){

how to make animation look like gravitation?

    setInterval(()=>{
      ctx.clearRect(0,0,1200,800);
      


    myGame.fruitsArr.forEach((eaachFruit)=> {
    eachFruit.drawItself()

    })
    }, 50);

  }
